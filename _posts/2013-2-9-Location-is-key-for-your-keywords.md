You may have heard of the term “geo-targeting” or “geo-segmentation.” This is in relation to a website advertising campaign which is focused on targeting specific location. You may wonder why this is important or if it is relevant to your business. The answer is yes.

Local search is becomingly increasingly important to reach your consumers on a different level. By segmenting your PPC campaigns and ad groups, you can have a much more significant impact and effective campaign on conversions and CPA (cost per action / acquisition).

Google allows advertisers to target PPC and other paid ads by geographic regions. Pending your brand goals and needs, you can break this down globally, regionally in the US, by state or even down to certain cities.

Geo-targeting is done by identifying the searcher’s IP address, and therefore the geographical location of the searcher. So, searchers within the specified area will see this ad that you have placed. Per your brand goals, this can be a powerful tool for web marketing.

Diving into your Google Analytics account to investigate your traffic sources is a great place to start. This will allow you to find where some of your traffic is currently coming from and then narrow down your spend from there.

Why is this important you ask? By tailoring your messages to a more targeted audience you are more likely to increase your CTR (click through rate) and garnish better CPA as your audience feels better about your local product/brand.

For example, if someone is looking for law services in their area, if there is a choice between “Rated #1 in Law Services” vs “New Jersey’s #1 Law Service”, the user is more likely to choose the latter. Integrating a geo-targeted strategy into your web marketing will be a key element to furthering your PPC success.
