This week in Adwords, Google shared some interesting findings from their partnership with Nielsen regarding mobile conversions.

While we are aware of the increasing number of mobile users, the default view from some advertisers was that users were searching on their phones and not necessarily converting. With technological updates on phones and ability to advertise on these devices, it’s no wonder that consumers are doing more of their research and making quick buying decisions on their phones.

Google took Nielsen’s information and analyzed over 6,000 mobile searches with when and where they converted. Research showed that over half of users searching on their phones are now converting within the hour. What does this mean for advertisers? If you weren’t paying attention to your mobile advertising much before, you may want to perk up and pay attention now. Evaluating your mobile strategy and web design is more pertinent than ever if you want to survive.
