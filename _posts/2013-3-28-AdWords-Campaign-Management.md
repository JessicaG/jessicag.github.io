title: Adwords Campaign Management: Upgrading
---
About two weeks ago, we talked about Google’s rolling out of enhanced campaigns. The three key changes to the AdWords changes which make them Enhanced:

Easier to manage
Showing your ads to users at the right time.
Better control over context of when your ad is being shown.
You’ll be able to market to the right user and the right time with a much simpler ease than before.
Better Ads.

Getting the right message to the right person at the right time.
The enhanced campaigns will enable you to match the user intent with the context of where they are, what device and time of day. Getting Started: Enhanced Campaigns pretty easy to transition to, but keep in mind that mobile bids will be automatically in there; so, be sure to review this prior to going live. Your initial transition should only take a few minutes per campaign.
Pro Tip: If you aren’t already using AdWords Editor, you should definitely download it for easier use of moving around and making edits to your campaigns. This can be especially helpful if you have your campaigns separated out by region or device and you have more than a few.

Some of you may have noticed that the default for all new campaigns is set to Enhanced, so make sure you’re aware of this when creating/editing these campaigns. Bid adjustment is pretty simple to do within the Settings and Bid Adjustments (which works in percentages up or down). Here you can see where your campaigns are running, the ad placement, and on which devices they’re appearing.

In the same area as the Settings tab, we have what they call Dimensions, which is allowing you to see your conversions and cost by day, URL, location and much more. Nerd alert here for reporting, yowza!

Depending on your business model, you will need to review how much this changes your strategy for AdWords, keyword placement, and ads, to optimize the effectiveness of your campaigns. Beginning in June, all campaigns will move to Enhanced Campaigns, so be sure to clean up your account before then, otherwise your ads will be duplicated on devices and may not show.

Til next time Googlers, Happy Friday and Play Ball (go Rockies)!
