I recently had the opportunity to visit Durango, (my college hometown!) with my Go Code Colorado colleagues for a site visit. We had meetings lined up with people from top to bottom and left to right, but nothing could’ve prepared us for what we received while we were there.

We had a two day whirlwind tour starting up at Fort Lewis and working our way down into town….

Steamworks Brewing
Audio Air
Chamber of Commerce
La Plata Alliance
Carvers
Durango Space
The Durango Herald
The Strater
Mercury Payment Systems
Seasons
Durango Public Library
The Double Tree Hotel
Lady Falconburgh's
Ska Brewing
Durango Arts Center

All to end with a Happy Hour finale with two of Durango’s finest tech groups; Durango Coders and Durango Tech at the Lost Dog! By the end of that night, we were running on adrenaline but ever so happy about it!

Let me tell ya, Durango, you’ve got it goin’ on. Twenty minutes north to get to Purgatory, twenty minutes south to get to New Mexico and running through you is the beautiful Animas River. I fell in love you with you all over again and everyone in town was so amazingly helpful. The entire visit we had an overwhelming amount of support and enthusiasm, so much so that the other small towns in this challenge should be worried! I think I’ve found where some developers have been hiding… Not only did we double our numbers that night, but we did it AGAIN last night. They’ve been hitting up Twitter promoting their event and getting people pumped up!

In addition, the community has really open up to show their support; we've been getting lots of positive feedback, and we had a great time meeting the mentors, volunteers, and partners.

Needless to say… our main event organizers are jealous of my cohort D.J. Davis and I because we have this amazing town to spend 4 days with for the 2014 Go Code Colorado Apps Challenge. We are so excited to bring this down to you and so thankful for an amazing trip this past weekend.

14 days and counting until we will see all your stellar faces again! Keep up the good work Durango, and to everyone else… Watch out! Little D-town is in it to WIN IT.
